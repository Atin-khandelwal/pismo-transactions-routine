# Pismo Transaction Routine

### Overview

This project is issued by Pismo to create apis to registers accounts, fetch customer's
account details and generate a transaction.
Each cardholder (customer) has an account with their data.
For each operation done by the customer a transaction is created and associated with their
respective account.
Each transaction has a specific type (normal purchase, withdrawal, credit voucher or
purchase with installments)
Transactions of type purchase and withdrawal are registered with negative amounts, while
transactions of credit voucher are registered with positive value.

### Project Structure

The project structure is based on the hexagonal architecture model, which aims to separate what is
an external dependency and what is the core of the application.

Therefore, the transaction was separate into domain, adapters and configs.

- *Domain*: layer responsible for to concentrate the business rules.
- *Adapters*: layer responsible for to concentrate external dependencies.
- *Configs*: layer responsible for to concentrate all the configurations for run this service.

Next, a drawing with the idea of architecture.

### Application Tests

At this moment the application is coverage by 100%. To achieve this, end-to-end testing was used,
unit tests for business rules and domain settings and entities ignored in coverage. You can check
the data accessing *target/site/index.html*, and you need to past all way to the *index.html*.
